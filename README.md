# 4x4-Keypad-Reader-on-a-Xilinx-Artix-7-FPGA
This implementation allows reading a 4x4 keypad without an external IC encoder (like the 74C922/23). It performs the same function as the IC, but in a simpler form. This module can be used in various projects, such as a calculator. A detailed explanation is provided in the README file.
